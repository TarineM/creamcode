# creamcode

The main project is to know more of cosmetic products by their ingredients and show some alternatives

Here there are Back (with Models, Repository, FileSystem and BDD)
and Front (template and integration)

There are two types of user:
- Admin --> manage brands, ingredients, labels, products, blog ...
- Client --> get products by search and read blog

I use some principles like :
- POO: Entity models are objects with properties
- SOLID: each controller has their actions, and some files have interface or abstract class
- MVC: Back (Models and Controller) and Front (View)
