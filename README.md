# creamcode

The main project is to know more of cosmetic products by their ingredients and show some alternatives

# Principles used :
- POO: Entity models are objects with properties
- SOLID: each controller has their actions, and some files have interface or abstract class
- MVC: Back (Models and Controller) and Front (View)


# Back:
- Controllers --> gestion view and models
- FileSystem --> Folder and Image (some entities need)
- Models --> entities and its repository
- Security --> check form in controllers, it's act like Validator
- Application is to run the site through default page
- Http & Render --> display content page and redirection
- Languages / Components --> PHP - MySQL

# Front:
- Admin --> to manage brands, ingredients, labels, products, blog ...
- Client --> get products by search and read blog
- Shared --> some template are used in admin and client
- Integration --> CSS, javascript (and bootstrap)
- Languages / Components / Packages --> Bootstrap, jQuery, HTML, CSS
